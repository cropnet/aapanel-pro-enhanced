    We are not hackers. We are not crackers.
    We are security researchers with a curiosity problem.
    
    We believe:

    - Every wall has a crack
    - Every crack has a purpose
    - Every purpose teaches a lesson
    
    We understand:
    - Coffee is a dependency, not an enhancement
    - Documentation is written for future-you, who has amnesia
    - Backups are like insurance: boring until you need them
    - rm -rf is a privilege, not a command
    
    We acknowledge:
    - Production servers are sacred
    - Test environments are for testing, not hoping
