# 🎭 DEVELOPER NOTES
# ============================================================================
# The following files are tracked because they contain developer humor,
# philosophy, and essential existential crisis management tools.
# They're basically Easter eggs, but useful ones.
# 
# Included:
# - .underground (poetry, mantras, coffee level matrix)
# - .DEV_NOTES (the unfiltered developer commentary)
#
# Why track these?
# 1. Future developers deserve to smile
# 2. They're not secrets, they're culture
# 3. Every repo needs a soul
# 4. Someone took the time to write them at 3 AM
#
# "Code is poetry" - WordPress
