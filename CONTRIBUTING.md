Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project.

## Philosophy

This project exists to:
- **Understand** software licensing systems
- **Document** security mechanisms
- **Educate** about system architecture
- **Improve** security through transparency

This project does NOT exist to:
- Enable software piracy
- Harm aaPanel or BT.cn
- Violate intellectual property rights
- Promote unethical behavior

## How to Contribute

### Research Contributions

If you've discovered new licensing mechanisms or improvements:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b research/new-finding`)
3. **Document** your research thoroughly
4. **Test** your modifications extensively
5. **Submit** a pull request

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is as important as code:

- Fix typos and grammatical errors
- Improve clarity and explanations
- Add examples and use cases
- Translate to other languages

### Bug Reports

If something doesn't work:

1. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) first
2. Include your aaPanel version
3. Include your OS version
4. Provide error logs
5. Describe steps to reproduce

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality

- **Comment your code**: Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Follow PEP 8**: For Python code
- **Test thoroughly**: On multiple aaPanel versions if possible
- **Include rollback**: Every modification must be reversible

### Documentation Standards

- **Use Markdown**: Follow standard Markdown formatting
- **Be clear**: Assume the reader is learning
- **Be accurate**: Test everything you document
- **Be ethical**: Always emphasize educational purpose

### Commit Messages

Good commit examples:
```
docs: Fix typo in troubleshooting guide
research: Add v6.16.0 compatibility notes
fix: Improve Python cache clearing in installer
```

Bad commit examples:
```
Update stuff
Fixed it
asdf
```

Format: `type: description`

Types:
- `research:` - New security research findings
